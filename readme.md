ENGO 551 - Lab 4
Calgary Building Permits & Traffic Incidents Map

This web app builds off of Lab 3 by adding a galaxy-themed traffic incidents 
layer to our existing Calgary building permits map. Users can now toggle 
between viewing just building permits or seeing both permits and traffic incidents 
together in a cosmic visualization!

Main Features
- Map shows building permits based on date range
- Toggle button to show/hide the galaxy-themed traffic incidents layer
- Click on markers to see building permit details

My Design
For my traffic incidents map, I went with a cosmic galaxy theme:
- Dark purple background like deep space
- Bright purple/pink glowing areas where incidents occurred
- Made the permit markers match with purple colors
- Added a starry effect by using small pixel sizes in Mapbox


How to use app
1. Pick a date range
2. Hit "Search Permits" 
3. Check the box to see the galaxy traffic layer
4. Explore

Tech stuff
- Leaflet.js for the map
- Mapbox for the custom galaxy style
- Open Calgary API for the data

Data from: Calgary Open Data Portal (building permits and 2017 traffic incidents)
